          "Nothing in the world can take the place of Persistence. Talent will
          not; nothing is more common than unsuccessful men with talent. <br />
          Genius will not; unrewarded genius is almost a proverb. Education will
          not; the world is full of educated derelicts. The slogan 'Press On'
          <br />
          has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race."

        <p class="discription">
          CI used to think that “success” in life meant living every moment in a
          way that I would not later regret. How ironic it’s been as I look back
          on my life and have too many regrets to count! What I’ve learned has
          helped me personally is that I have to be patient with myself and
          accept that things won’t go well a lot of the time, but zoom out and
          look at the big picture.
